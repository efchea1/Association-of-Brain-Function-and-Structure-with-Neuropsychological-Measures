Used R to explore whether Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) biomarkers (FA, MD) relate to cognitive function (TOVA) in Hurler syndrome. Found significant group differences in FA/MD values but no differential impact on TOVA d-prime by group. Analysis involved t-tests, regression models, and interaction terms.
